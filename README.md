## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express, JSON, Node.js, npm

Utilized a read mechanism from the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) framework using Express & Javascript and listened for requests on port 8000 of a localhost.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Rather than just printing the rapper name object filled with rapper objects in the console, we actually allowed the response to respond with the rapper name requested and all their information.

## Lessons Learned:

The CRUD method syntax is similar to how we would use an EventListener method.

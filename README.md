rap APi, server to be pushed to heroku.

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (front & backend)

Created an API using JS and frontend interaction with JS as well. It's a simple interface with event listeners tied to submit button, pulling data from a form to request specific rapper name and lyrics

Optimizations

I'd love to have expanded this greater functionality, such as with multiple rappers submitted a la rap battle.

Lessons Learned:

Spent a bit of time going over code looking for flaws and I simply forgot to get main.js in the server file. Always check to see if every thing is gotten, so I don't get got.

Side note, since no node modules, make sure to npm init > npm install express --save
